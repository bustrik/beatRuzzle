#### beatRuzzle - A simple program to find words in a Ruzzle(tm) schema

DISCLAIMER:
I am NOT a Java developer, neither a developer at all.
I've just studied a bit of Java in my Computer Science faculty,
so I'm not taking responsabilities like burning out your computer, etc...

DISCLAIMER 2:
Don't use this class for cheating in Ruzzle game.
At least don't say you're cheating: your friends won't ever wanna play with you!

#### Five W:

Who:
my name is David, it's all you wanna know.

What:
As I said, this is a simple Java program to let you find words in a Ruzzle(TM) schema;

When and Where:
In my spare time - at work;

Why:
Because I suck in Ruzzle(TM)
It's also a way (for me) to know if I can remember anything about Java.
